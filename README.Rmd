A connector between [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3) and [batchtools](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/).
This allows to run large-scale benchmark experiments on scheduled high-performance computing clusters.

The package comes with two core functions for switching between `mlr3` and `batchtools` to perform a benchmark:

* After creating a `design` object (as required for `mlr3`'s `benchmark()` function), instead of `benchmark()` call `batchmark()` which populates
  an `ExperimentRegistry` for the computational jobs of the benchmark.
  You are now in the world of `batchtools` where you can selectively submit jobs with different resources, monitor the progress or resubmit as needed.
* After the computations are finished, collect the results with `reduceResultsBatchmark()` to return to `mlr3`.
  The resulting object is a regular `BenchmarkResult`.

## Example

```{r}
library("mlr3")
library("batchtools")
library("mlr3batchmark")
tasks = tsks(c("iris", "sonar"))
learners = lrns(c("classif.featureless", "classif.rpart"))
resamplings = rsmp("cv", folds = 3)

design = benchmark_grid(
  tasks = tasks,
  learners = learners,
  resamplings = resamplings
)

reg = makeExperimentRegistry(NA)
ids = batchmark(design, reg = reg)

submitJobs()
getStatus()

reduceResultsBatchmark()
```
